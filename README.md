# Practice: DOM Manipulation

`Here a practice was carried out creating a "To-do list" to learn how to use the DOM together with HTML5/CSS.`

The DOM is an interface that allows programs to interact with HTML documents.
Represents the document as a structure of objects.
Allows you to access, modify and update the content, style and structure of the document.

Examples of DOM usage:

Add dynamic content to a web page.
Change the style of a web page according to the user's preferences.
Validate the input of a form.
Create interactive web applications.
